          <p>Many know Justin Wren as a national champion wrestler who became a Bellator MMA &filig;ghter. However, a mission trip to the Congo several years ago changed his life forever. His new &filig;ght in life became freeing the Mbuti Pygmy tribe from modern day slavery, who were without a voice and access to clean water. Justin partnered with Water4 to provide both, and they ultimately joined forces. Since returning to the cage, Wren has stopped fighting for himself and started fighting for people. He now fights with a new passion under the name his second family gave him, Justin &quot;The Big Pygmy&quot; Wren.<br><br>
            &nbsp; 	Together we can empower people to save lives and be the solution to the water crisis for all. Help bring light to the world with EcoSurvivor products and empower people with access to clean water.<br>
